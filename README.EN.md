## Overview


### Given:
JS, CSS (SCSS, SASS)
The maximum time to complete the task is 2 weeks.
The goal of the assignment is to write a TODO List application.

### Basic goals:
- The application must include at least two main components (see the figure above for an example of the application):
 1) Vertical list with names of TODO notes;
 2) TODO note interaction area.
-  Implement the ability to add, edit and delete TODO notes;
- Trim the end of the TODO note name “…” if the name does not fit into the vertical list of TODO note names.

### Additional goals:
- Add color indication of progress status of TODO notes execution (states: pending/in progress/completed);
- Add TODO notes search by name;
- Add the ability to change the width of the list of names of TODO notes by holding and moving the right border with the mouse cursor;
- Implement an application in React+JS or React+TS (preferably use createReactApp https://create-react-app.dev/);

The use of frameworks and libraries other than React is not allowed. Commenting on code with explanations is a must.
Place the solution to the problem on https://github.com/
The link to the solution must be inserted into a Word file and attached to the internship application.
